### Cristian explanation

* I develop this app with REACT and carbon components. This have been my first time working with carbon components and it has been interesting because always is good learning something new.
Also I worked with SCSS
* To create a clean, maintainable and well-designed code I used Eslint that is a linting tool for JavaScript and JSX whose function is to review our code trying to find errors that could cause compilation problems or future bugs in our development.
* To test code I used Jest.

## Pending tasks

* Search bar not run because I need more time to implement this action.
* Date picker need a little action to run completely, just need to see label correctly.
* Testing is 70% all coverage. With test I have bit experience

That all, I hope that I have lived up to the challenge
